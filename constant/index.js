          "Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human lives and have gained increasing attention as the tenth leading cause of global mortality. This study addresses the pressing issue of brain tumor classification using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It focuses on distinguishing between Low-Grade Gliomas (LGG) and High-Grade Gliomas (HGG). LGGs are benign and typically manageable with surgical resection, while HGGs are malignant and more aggressive. The research introduces an innovative custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model, Glioma-CNN. GliomaCNN stands out as a lightweight CNN model compared to its predecessors. The research utilized the BraTS 2020 dataset for its experiments. Integrated with the gradient-boosting algorithm, GliomaCNN has achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.1569%. The modelâ€™s interpretability is ensured through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM++). They provide insights into critical decision-making regions for classification outcomes. Despite challenges in identifying tumors in images without visible signs, the model demonstrates remarkable performance in this critical medical application, offering a promising tool for accurate brain tumor diagnosis which paves the way for enhanced early detection and treatment of brain tumors.",

          "Informational Queries are those queries or questions where a user's goal is to get an answer or fact to a specific question or to find a relevant piece of information. In recent years, social media has become an important platform for people to seek knowledge, data, and information from others. However, the vast amount of information on social media makes it difficult to identify and prioritize posts that are specifically informational queries. This paper presents machine learning and transfer learning methods for detecting informational queries on social media in the Bengali language using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The approach involves analyzing the text of posts to identify keywords and phrases commonly used in informational queries and using this information to train machine learning classifiers, including transfer learning models. The method was evaluated on a dataset of real-world Bengali social media posts and was effective in accurately identifying posts that are informational queries with high precision and recall. This work aims to assist organizations and individuals in providing support to individuals seeking information, data, and knowledge on social media, particularly in low-resource languages.",

The study focuses on evaluating the accuracy of these models' predictions as well as their ability to employ appropriate features for image categorization. To gain insights into the strengths and limitations of the model's predictions, the study employs the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework. The findings of this experiment indicate that LIME is a crucial tool for improving the interpretability and dependability of machine learning models for image identification, regardless of the models achieving an f1 score of 0.99 on classifying traffic and road signs. The conclusion of this study has important ramifications for how these models are used in practice, as it is crucial to ensure that model predictions are founded on the pertinent image features.",

          "In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, everyone wants things to happen quickly. Thanks to the internet, news spreads super fast. But not all news is important. News summarization helps by giving a short version of each news story, so readers can easily figure out what type of news they want to read. There are two main types of summarization: Abstractive Text Summarization and Extractive Text Summarization. The process of abstractive text summarization is much more complex than that of extractive text summarization. This study proposes a model for generating extractive summaries, which are then utilized as input to generate abstractive summaries. The model uses the Bengali Text Summarization (BenSumm) model for extractive summarization and the Bangla Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (BanlaT5) for abstractive summarization. The research also compares summarization acquired straight from the BanglaT5 model with summarization obtained via the proposed model. Abstractive summarization in the Bengali language has been accomplished using the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer(T5) in this research. Although abstractive summarization of the Bengali language has been accomplished over the years using a variety of techniques, the field of using T5 in this field has only recently been discovered, and there is still a wide range of opportunities to be explored. The study has achieved promising results.",

A robot waiter may make a huge impact in a restaurant in this situation. This research led to the formation of a low-cost Arduino-based Android application control Robot that can work as a restaurant waiter. The proposed model can follow a path, avoid obstacles, serve meals to a specific consumer, and return to the kitchen on its own. To precisely follow the line, the PID algorithm is utilized. To detect potential obstructions, a sonar sensor is used. On an LCD, messages and warnings are displayed. An Android app that allows the chief to select a particular table for serving meals. For convenience, the robot's current state is displayed in the application. Our testing results show that the robot performs satisfactorily over 90% of the time. It should be emphasized that the offered model is adaptable to any restaurant.",
