          . I graduated from the same university with a Bachelor&apos;s degree
          in Computer Science and Engineering. I am a passionate programmer with
          expertise in C, C++, and Python. I have hands-on experience in
          robotics and have completed various projects. I am very much
          interested in the field of Robotics and Computer Vision works.

          From the beginning of my university life, I have had a strong passion
          for programming, participating in numerous programming competitions
          and occasionally joining robotics competitions. In my third year,
          second semester, I published my first research paper, kickstarting my
          journey in research. My research interests include robotics, natural
          language processing (NLP) and computer vision. I have successfully
          applied these technologies to various real-life projects.
