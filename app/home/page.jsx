        From the beginning of my university life, I have had a strong passion
        for programming, participating in numerous programming competitions and
        occasionally joining robotics competitions. In my third year, second
        semester, I published my first research paper, kickstarting my journey
        in research. My research interests include robotics, natural language
        processing (NLP) and computer vision. I have successfully applied these
        technologies to various real-life projects.
